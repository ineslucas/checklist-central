# âœ… Checklist Central: Simplifying Repetitive Task Management

Checklist Central is a Ruby on Rails application designed to automate and simplify the organization of repeating activities, such as packing for trips or preparing for events. This project incorporates Stimulus JS and Turbo to enhance interactivity and responsiveness, focusing on providing a seamless user experience for automating task management. It was one of my first experiences exploring the Ruby on Rails development ecosystem through the [Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev) set of web development technologies.

I created it because everytime I go to the gym, an event or a trip, I typically have to re-do my to-do list to make sure I've packed everything. Not anymore! ðŸ˜Š

## ðŸš€ Main Feature

- **Automated Task Management:** Allows users to create and manage checklists for recurring activities, automating the preparation process.
- **(In Progress) Efficient Task Reset:** A planned feature to enable users to uncheck all tasks, facilitating the restart of preparations for the same activity without manual reset.

## ðŸ›  Technologies

- **Ruby on Rails:** Utilized for its powerful framework capabilities in building efficient and scalable web applications.
- **Stimulus JS:** Incorporated to enhance the interactivity of the application without the need for complex JavaScript frameworks.
- **Turbo Frames and Streams:** Used to streamline navigation and actions without the full page reloads, making the application faster and more responsive.

## ðŸ“… Current Status

The project is under development, with specific attention to:

- Finalizing the implementation of key missing features such as the task reset functionality.
- Styling enhancements for Show and Edit pages to improve usability and visual appeal.
- Achieving mobile responsiveness to ensure accessibility on all devices.
- Deployment.

## ðŸŒ± Learning Outcomes

- **Integrating Rails with Modern JavaScript:** Exploring the integration of Stimulus JS and Turbo within a Rails application to enhance interactivity and responsiveness.
- **UI/UX Design in Rails:** Focusing on the aesthetic and functional design aspects of web development, especially in form design and page styling.
- **Adapting to Changing Requirements:** Navigating the ongoing development process, adapting plans, and implementing new features in response to evolving project needs.

## ðŸš§ Next Steps

- **Completing Missing Features:** Prioritizing the development of the reset functionality, page styling, and mobile responsiveness.
- **Deployment:** Planning for the future deployment of Checklist Central to share this tool with people looking to streamline their task management processes.

Checklist Central blends technical development skills with a keen eye for design, showcasing the potential of Ruby on Rails in creating applications that are not only functional but also visually appealing and user-friendly.
